# DRUMGRID | FRONTEND

## `Introduction`

This app is a graduation project for the web development bootcamp from IronHack.

Because I am a music lover, I wanted to create a music drum machine application where the power of React could be shown, coupled with an API backend system accessed via Axios connected to MongoDB to create and/or modify your account (profile) in order to store, load or delete your music compositions.
